# 📸 Memory Vault

**Memory Vault** is a full-stack **MERN application** that helps users digitally preserve their memories — just like framing photos on walls or sticking them on a fridge, but in a **secure, personal, and interactive digital space**.

Users can log in, create memory stories with images, descriptions, dates, and locations, mark their favorite memories, and manage their personal profile — all in one place.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Whenever we visit beautiful places or experience special moments, we capture photos. Over time, these memories get lost in phone galleries.

**Memory Vault** solves this by allowing users to turn photos into **stories**, storing not just images but also the emotions and experiences behind them.

Each memory becomes a **story card** that can be:
- Edited
- Deleted
- Searched
- Marked as a favorite ❤️
